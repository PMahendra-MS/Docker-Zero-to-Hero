"I have been tasked with creating a strategy document outlining a comprehensive DevOps workflow for our development team.
Please provide a detailed, structured referral strategy document template or a comprehensive example that covers key areas, including:
Continuous Integration (CI): Code committed, automated build, testing, and feedback loops.
Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD): Automated deployment to staging and production environments.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Management and provisioning of infrastructure through code.
Monitoring & Logging: Tools and processes for observing application performance and health.
Collaboration & Culture: How teams will work together and the cultural shifts required.
Tools & Technology Stack: Recommended tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Kubernetes, Prometheus).
Security (DevSecOps): Integrating security practices throughout the pipeline
